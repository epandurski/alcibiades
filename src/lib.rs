//! This crate provides a framework for writing chess engines.
//!
//! # Why chess engines?
//!
//! Simple! Chess is the greatest thing humans have
//! invented. Computers follow closely ;)
//!
//! # Why a framework?
//!
//! There is lots of knowledge out there about how to write a chess
//! engine, and there is a lot of room for innovation also. Writing a
//! chess engine is fun, but even for the simplest engine there is a
//! lot of complex (and boring) things that have to be implemented
//! first: the UCI protocol communication, the rules, the static
//! exchange evaluator, and many more. Thousands of programmers have
//! been re-implementing those things over and over again.
//!
//! So, if you want to write your own chess engine, you face an
//! unpleasant choice: You either roll up your sleeves and implement
//! all the hard stuff from scratch, or you take someone else's chess
//! engine and struggle to understand its cryptic, undocumented source
//! code, hoping that it will be general enough to allow
//! modification. This unfortunate situation stifles innovation.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! * Modular design. Users can write their own implementations for
//!   every part of the chess engine.
//!
//! * Very good default implementations -- move generation, quiescence
//!   search, static exchange evaluation, time management, iterative
//!   deepening, multi-PV, aspiration windows, generic transposition
//!   table.
//!
//! * Very complete UCI support (including "searchmoves").
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! This crate is [on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/alcibiades)
//! and can be used by adding `alcibiades` to your dependencies in
//! your project's `Cargo.toml`.
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! alcibiades = "0.3.0"
//! ```
//!
//! and this to your crate root:
//!
//! ```rust
//! extern crate alcibiades;
//! ```
//!
//! Here is how simple it is to create a chess engine using this crate:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! extern crate alcibiades;
//! use alcibiades::stock::*;
//! use alcibiades::engine::run_uci;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     type Ttable = StdTtable<StdTtableEntry>;
//!     type SearchNode = StdSearchNode<StdQsearch<StdMoveGenerator<SimpleEvaluator>>>;
//!     type SearchExecutor = Deepening<SimpleSearch<Ttable, SearchNode>>;
//!     run_uci::<SearchExecutor, StdTimeManager>("My engine", "John Doe", vec![]);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This engine is assembled from the "in stock" implementations of
//! the different framework traits.
//!
//! In reality, you will probably want to write your own
//! implementations for some of the framework traits. Thanks to Rust's
//! incredible generic programming capabilities, you are not limited
//! to implementing only the methods required by the traits. For
//! example you may write your own static position evaluator which has
//! a `consult_endgame_table` method. Then you will be able to write a
//! search algorithm that uses this method.
//!
//! # Speed and safety
//!
//! This crate tries to be fast *and* memory-safe.
