//! Facilities for implementing game-tree searchers.
//!
//! Chess programs must rely on some type of search in order to play
//! reasonably. Searching involves looking ahead at different move
//! sequences and evaluating the positions after making the
//! moves. Normally, this is done by traversing and min-maxing a
//! tree-like data-structure by some algorithm.
//!
//! To implement your own search algorithm, you must define a type
//! that implements the `SearchExecutor` trait.
