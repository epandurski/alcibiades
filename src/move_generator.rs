/// A `MoveGenerator` holds a chess position and can:
///
/// * Calculate Zobrist hashes.
///
/// * Find which pieces and pawns attack a given square.
///
/// * Find if the side to move is in check.
///
/// * Generate all legal moves, or a subset of all legal moves in the
///   current position.
///
/// * Generate a null move.
///
/// * Verify if a random move digest represents a proper move.
///
/// * Play a selected move and take it back.
///
/// * Provide a static evaluator bound to the current position.
///
/// * Perform static exchange evaluation for the generated moves.
///
/// **Important note:** `MoveGenerator` is unaware of repeating
/// positions and rule-50.
